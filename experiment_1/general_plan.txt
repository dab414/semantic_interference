	Try to match the means and results from the original report
	done

3 - Descriptives
	Take a closer look at descriptive trends in the data
	done

4 - Model fit and evaluation
	Find a model that fits
		this will be hard given all the factors

	Evaluate fit via k-fold validation

	Generate uncertainty estimates around parameters via bootstrapping
		this and the previous step covered here: https://rpubs.com/ledongnhatnam/241926

		^ i'll also have to find a way to estimate significance of parameters, lmer doesn't give ps

	Generate and plot predictions
