trying to convert this god awful dataset into something manageable

Procedure[Block]
	testproc = block 1
	testproc1 = block 2

it looks like slide2 is where list level information is stored
	she also has highlighted `Slide2.RESP`, assuming this is where they enter how they think the items are related

to the right of slide2:
	`truth` is the correct category of the list
	`correct` is the correct name of the instance

prompt 1 & 2 are very important
	prompt 1 corresponds to reponses from block 1, 2 to 2
	this stores trial-level RT
	it also stores prompt1.OnsetTime, which can be used to put things back in order

so, for each subject, order by prompt1 onset time then by prompt 2 onset time

list id is stored wide in:
	Cathet1:8; Cathomo1:8; same for RAT
	im deleting her stupid long conversions

important vars:
	"Subject" = subject
	"Relatedness" = context factor 
	"First Half Connection" = type of list (rat vs cat) and whether they guessed the list theme correctly (blank for block 2, where lists are labeled)
		im guessing (in first half) we're dropping observations on this var where value = "rat correct" (there should be 12 out of 84)
	"Correct" = item
	"Procedure[Block]" = testproc is block 1, testproc1 is block 2
	"prompt1.RT" = RTs in block 1
	"prompt2.RT" = RTs in block 2
	"Error?" = 'x' if yes, blank if no
		recoding to "error", 1 if yes, 0 if no
	"ItemType.Real" = item type (RAT vs category)
	"Cycle" = which cycle of list presentations are we in? (each list type was presented consecutively 5 times, order of items randomized within list)
