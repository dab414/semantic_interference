block X context X item type X cycle

considered removing third item in each cycle because it's completely predictable

first step would be to try to replicate the anova results from their spss analysis



experiment 1 (method starts around p 25)

factors:
	item type (RAT vs common category)
	context (homogeneous vs heterogeneous)
	labeling (labeled vs nonlabeled)
	she also throws in cycle seemingly out of nowhere
	solvability (solvable, unsolvable, unrelated) ## i don't think this factor was in exp1, however

speculative:
	each list contains three items
	each list was presented for five cycles
	the five cycles for each list were presented consecutively 
	the order of cycle type (i.e., RAT vs common & context) was random within blocks
	labeling was systematically manipulated between halves of the experiment; WHY?
		such that the first half was always unlabeled, the second half was always labeled
		so in text they actually just refer to the factor "label" as block, of which there were only 2 (mapping on to two halves of the experiment)


trimming:
	rts <= 150ms removed
	during the first half with no label, RAT sets were excluded if Ps successfully stated the solution to the set
		12 out of 84 total RAT sets removed, 6 for shell RAT, 6 for tree rat
	also during first half, common category sets were removed when Ps failed to identify common category
		2 out of 84 sets removed
	removing third item of each cycle

design
	it looks like the design she reports is what i indicated above
		block X context X item type X cycle
