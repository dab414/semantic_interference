6/8
	finished model selection
	did kfolds
		learned that a model without random effects actually predict the data better...

6/5

	a little mad at my past self, the notes weren't great
	I came up with the new model using the `:` notation, but I can't find the source for that
	the model doesn't converge (on the laptop) using bobyqa optimizer
	also the fixed effects structure is such a disaster because the model estimates a parameter for *each* level of all categorical vars
		did i ever figure out what a solution to that is??
		that's in addition to all the interactions...
		hmm okay but when you run the Wald test with car::Anova it actually estimates significance appropriately
		and i guess part of the idea with the bootstrapping is that you can organically get significance for parameters
	it's clear i did the inferential notebook in a hurry, or at least didn't feel like annotating it, and now paying the price for that

Inferential analyses

	one challenge will be figuring out how to deal with all these categorical factors in the model
	do i dummy code...?
	if not how do i interpret?

	golden pony: http://www.mypolyuweb.hk/~sjpolit/coding_schemes.html
		from here:
			dummy coding for factors is default
			to see how factors are default coded: contrasts(current_data$factor_var)
			dummy coding is only good for looking at simple effects
				need effect coding to look at main effects or effect thats a subset of the design
					eg a two-way interaction in a three-way design
				doesn't talk about how to deal with categorical variable with > 2 levels
					especially confusing if num levels is odd
				oooh use model comparison: http://www.page-gould.com/r/anova/
					look up how to use `:` notation when specifying model formula

	i also downloaded another bates paper (~ 50 pgs) and put it with the rest of the mixed model resources


	trying to run with only main effects of slopes:
		m1 <- lmer(rt ~ cycle * item_type * context * block + (1 + cycle + item_type + context + block | subject) + (1  + cycle + item_type + context + block | item), data = current_data)

	hasn't converged and it's been prob ~ 15-20 min
