4/6
	I believe I left off with having finished the preprocessing
	So i think the next step will be to try and reproduce the ANOVA analyses
	
	just dropped like 45 min cuz I used is.null() instead of is.na() in preprocessing
		now im frustrated and exhausted

	In trying to match her SPSS output, I matched the estimated cell means perfectly, and the ANOVA estimates were pretty close (SPSS does use type 3 SS)

	What she reports in the thesis text is wildly inconsistent with both my results and what she has in the SPSS document
		i just told pat about this

	Waiting for his feedback and we'll go from there.
